      <p className="text"> Transport is a fundamental requirement of modern life, but the traditional combustion engine is quickly becoming outdated. 
      Petrol or diesel vehicles are highly polluting and are being quickly replaced by fully electric vehicles. Fully electric vehicles (EV) have zero tailpipe emissions and are much better for the environment. The electric vehicle revolution is here, and you can be part of it.
